# cunegonda-online
"Cunegonda" is an online strategic card game for 4 players. The main reason for his success is his clever and planned nature, nobody is safe and a small mistake can cause huge losses.

'Cunegonda' is an individual game but, as for everything, teaming is natural, if you are winning expect 3 other players against you, if you are losing you have plenty of chances to climb back up if you play your cards correctly. Everybody can overturn the standings, you can pass from first to last and back again to first in a matter of few rounds, the game is over only when the 10th round finishes.

To open the client run the script ``launcher.py``
To open the server run the script ``host.py``
You can run the python modules by navigating to the directory where you extracted the files and executing the command:
